In this project I created decentralized NFT marketplace smart contract with the following functions and events emitted for each of them:<br>
    1. `listItems`: List NFTs on the marketplace<br>
    2. `buyItems`: Buy the NFTs from the marketplace<br>
    3. `cancelItems`: Cancel a listing<br>
    4. `updateListing`: Update the price of the NFT already listed<br>
    5. `withdrawProceeds`: Withdraw payment for my bought NFTs
